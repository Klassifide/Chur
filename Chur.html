    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h1>
    <p>
      Greetings and welcome, my name is Navarone Kaina Cree Martin. I am of
      rarotongan and maori descent. Currently I am 31 years old. Life has been a
      wild rollercoaster so far, and I'm glad with how far I've come. Partaking
      in this Take2 course feels like a step in the right direction again. I
      look forward to learning as much as possible and aim to apply it to my
      everyday life. Before this I pursued love halfway across the globe and
      tried to make electronic music for a living. After going through some life
      changing experiences I came home after 8 years spent overseas living in
      various european countries such as Germany, Ibiza, The Netherlands and
      Finland. I thoroughly enjoy listening and dancing to edm, dubstep, techno,
      hip hop and riddim music. My favourite and most influential artists include
      Steve Aoki, Flume, Datsik, Borgore, Swindle, Alix Perez, Hol!, SuddenDeath,
      Joker, Eminem, Subtronics, Monxx, Infekt, and every other artist who creates amazing
      music. Now the path of life has led myself to the point of learning how to
      code. I find this an enjoyable learning experience and believe a brighter
      prosperious future awaits because programmes like Take2 exist.
    </p>
    <h2>Taha Tinana</h2>
    <p>For taha tinana, having just received authorisation to attend the gym 3
      times a week grants a health benefit to my current schedule of a new
      beginning. I used to spend all weekend dancing whilst in Germany which helps
    keep you fit but in the long run can prove to be not that healthy. Especially staying
  awake between 48-96 hours just because the clubs are open that long. I miss the culture
and the clubbing as in New Zealand is nothing like that at all. </p>
    <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
<p>For taha Hinengaro my goal is to be more social and become
  comfortable with speaking publically and/or addressing a crowd or group of
  people. For emotional wellbeing, I subconciously remind my mind everyday to be happy and 
outgoing regardless of how external or negative thoughts might try to apply themselves. 
Recently being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia is something new, but if I am to 
be completely honest it feels like simply the aftershocks of having been attacked with
magic, something before my experiences overseas I would not normally believe in.  </p>
<h2>Taha Whanau</h2>   
<p>For Taha Whanau, I must make a note that I've had falling outs with family and some old
  friends over my decision to take off overseas some 10 years ago now. Although I'm currently
  disqualified from driving as well as having my home detention sentence to serve, when this 
  is complete I aim to reintegrate with my old friends especially. I have problems with my older
  sister as I am to blame (they call me the devil lol) for a lot "if not all" of our immediate
  family's problems growing up. My sister takes it to heart that I got to travel instead of her
  however it would still be nice to visit her potentially.
</p>
<h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
<p>Taha Wairua, the spiritual. Related to this, my spiritual are a bit unique and illuminati
  related, which is not always what people think. For example not fearing death. I remember
  certain paths to take and things that need to be done. Also after a near death experience 
  I managed to come out of body and visit the spirit realm, a plane of existence attached to 
  this one. The experience was induced from a car crash and felt like a psychedelic trip except
  breathing and experiencing what was happening feels more lifelike than life itself. This too 
  is related to the illuminati as I found myself in one of their houses which was occupied by
  floating talking heads. Related to my spiritual goals I aim to delve deeper into these experiences
  and want to learn as much as possible about everything to do with what has been withheld from
  the majority of the human race; of which a lot of the illuminati is about. 
</p>
<h2>Taha Whenua</h2>
Taha Whenua. For the people. 
<h2>SHORT TERM GOALS</h2>

    <p>
      My other short term goals include making maximum effort to show up and learn as
      much as possible everyday that is available to do so. Putting attention on
      remembering all the pathways and functions that we are learning and
      applying them in our own projects really helps to maintain mental clarity. Showing up
      everyday is an easier one as there are 4 other days in the week to do nothing but stay home.

      
    </p>

    <h2>Long term goals</h2>

    <p>
      My main long term goal is to acquire a 350z motor vehicle. With the end of
      my probation comes being licensed to drive again. I find driving extremely
      therapeutic, so it's easy to place another edm sportscar as my main long
      term goal. Aside from that there is also the long term goal with the
      potential of earning a job placement with the completion of this course.
      With the new skills gained from this course I may eventually attempt to
      move back to Berlin legally, seeking a job in web development over there.
